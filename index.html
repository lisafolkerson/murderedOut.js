			<h2>Why Murdered Out?</h2>
			<p>Sometimes when we are on websites our screens produce a hefty amount of light. Industry front runners have addressed this issue through the creation of visually darker sites (Blackl, The Dark Side of Google, etc.). </p>

			<h2>How to Murder Out</h2>
			<p>Murdering out your website is simple. The first step is to include the muderedOut.js file and link to it in your HTML. Once you have linked the murderedOut.js file you need to call the murderedOut() function in your main scripts file. It will look a little something like this:</p>
			<pre>
				<code>
					"<script src="murderedOut.js"></script>"
				</code>
			</pre>
